###Introduction  
#### Background (Problem)  
1- Many job seekers do not find jobs due to lack of experience. They need to enhance their skills and work on them. However, they do not find the chance to make use of their skills and abilities.   
They may work as freelancers, but they do not get many offers as they are beginners in their field. So, they cannot find the opportunity to gain experience.  
2- On the other hand, many people seek services but are not willing to pay much money. Also, there are not many platforms for small services.  
3- Most platforms which provide services are not providing them for free. As people who work at them are professionals, they seek much money to provide a service.  

1.2 Purpose  
1- Our platform is a Service-Trading platform.   
2- Our purpose is to provide a platform for job seekers or people who want to work on their skills to enable them to make best use of their abilities and knowledge for free.   
Our application enables users to offer their services for free. All services are in exchange for virtual coins.   
4- Also, users who need any service can post a request so that other users could help them and offer them their services.   
Our application as a whole connects people who need services and others who can offer services. All transactions between them are for free.  
A user after practicing through the app will have a portfolio so that he/she, in the future, could gain from their skills.
